## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Denys, and I'm an aspiring data professional.
Feel free to explore my portfolio of data projects [here](https://github.com/NephriteLabs/Portfolio).

Recently, I've been working on improving my coding skills through numerous projects using Python libraries, mostly:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy, scipy and other..

I've worked on data transformation and cleaning, imported datasets into code, learned to make API requests in Python, and how to work with different data formats, such as JSON and CSV. 
Also, there's been quite a lot of SQL, advanced Excel features, dashboarding tools such as Power BI and Tableau, and basics of ML with scikit-learn.

Additionally, I'm currently improving my OOP skills in Python, explore various use cases and applications of SQL and digging further in ML concepts with TensorFlow library.
There's a lot to learn and I love it. Things don't seem to be too complicated, but there are certainly challenges. I do my best to put in as much effort and time as I can.

My goal is to get into Data Science by the next year and to dig further into advanced ML models and applications.
